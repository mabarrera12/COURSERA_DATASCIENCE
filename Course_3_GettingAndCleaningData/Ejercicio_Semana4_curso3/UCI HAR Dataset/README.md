# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Hi! According to the given instructions, the outcome of this project is an R code (run_analysis.R) that does the following: 

	* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
	* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
	* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
	* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
	* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How this script works? 

1. Download the `UCI HAR DATASET`  enter the folder. Set that path as your working directory such as `getwd() = .../UCI HAR Dataset"` 
2. Place the `run_analysis.R` file inside the folder.
3. Run the code.
